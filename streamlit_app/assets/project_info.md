<h2 class='sub-title'>🧬 Breast Cancer Diagnosis App </h2>

This interactive web application allows users to upload histopathology images and instantly receive a prediction indicating whether the sample is **benign** or **malign**. The prediction is powered by a deep learning model trained on real histopathology data.

## 📌 Objective

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in the world. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automate cancer detection from histopathology slides.

## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Upload** a histopathology image (PNG format).
2. The image is sent to a **FastAPI backend** hosted on Cloud Run.
3. The backend preprocesses the image and runs inference using a trained **CNN/VGG16 model**.
4. The prediction (Benign / Malignant) and confidence score are returned and displayed.
5. Prediction history is stored in **memory** per **session** (Streamlit session state).
